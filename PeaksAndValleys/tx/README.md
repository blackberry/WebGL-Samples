- Usage of the resource is as follows:

	Terragen is free for personal non-commercial use. In this case registration is optional, but it
	entitles you to additional benefits and removes the restriction on image size. For commercial use
	as described in the License Agreement, registration is required beyond the initial trial period.
	This also entitles you to additional benefits and removes the restriction on image size.
	Terragen is free during the initial trial period.
