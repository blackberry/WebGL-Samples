# WebGL-Samples

The _**WebGL-Samples**_ repository contains Open Sourced WebGL samples for the WebKit-based browser used by the 
BlackBerry&reg; Tablet OS.  WebGL is enabled on PlayBook OS 2.0 when used inside an HTML5 application packaged 
with [BlackBerry WebWorks](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5).  PlayBook OS 2.0 is currently available as a 
developer preview.

The WebGL samples will not run in the regular PlayBook browser due to security concerns.  However, when packaged 
with WebWorks, WebGL applications run the same as any other OpenGL app on the device.

These samples are open sourced under the [Apache 2.0 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

## Samples

There are currently two samples:

* TunnelTilt - This game is a WebWorks application that showcases WebGL running on the BlackBerry® platform.  Guide a glowing orb down several trippy tunnels while avoiding the obstacles.
* PeaksAndValleys - This sample combines common WebGL topics (lighting, skybox, terrain generation and pathing, movement, textures, etc.) and provides a sample implementation. Take a look, pick it apart, and build up something magical!
