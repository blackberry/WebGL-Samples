# WebGL-Samples

The _**WebGL-Samples**_ repository contains Open Source samples in WebGL for the WebKit-based browser used in 
BlackBerry&reg; Tablet OS.  WebGL is enabled on PlayBook OS 2.0 when used inside an HTML5 application packaged 
with [BlackBerry WebWorks](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5).  PlayBook OS 2.0 is is currently available as a 
developer preview.

The WebGL samples will not run in the regular PlayBook browser due to security concerns.  However, when packaged 
with WebWorks, WebGL applications run the same as any other OpenGL app on the device.

These samples are open sourced under the [Apache 2.0 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).
